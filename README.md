# LLM_PROJECT
PROJECT OVERVIEW:
     This project focuses on predicting mental health conditions among thalassemia patients using machine learning and large language models (LLMs). Thalassemia is a chronic blood disorder requiring lifelong treatment and frequent medical interventions, which often leads to significant psychological stress, anxiety, and depression. Early detection of mental health challenges can improve patient care, treatment adherence, and overall quality of life.
OBJECTIVES:
* To identify risk factors contributing to mental health issues in thalassemia patients.
* To build a predictive model that can assess the likelihood of mental health concerns.
* To leverage LLMs for analyzing patient data, reports, or questionnaires to enhance prediction accuracy.
* To provide a framework that can assist healthcare professionals in monitoring and supporting patients.
METHADOLOGY:
1) Data Collection
     Patient demographic data (age, gender, socioeconomic background).
     Clinical data (treatment history, transfusion frequency, complications).
     Psychological/behavioral data (surveys, self-reports, therapy records).
2) Preprocessing
    Cleaning, normalization, handling missing values.
   Feature engineering (stress factors, treatment adherence, family support, etc.).
3) Modeling
      Traditional ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
      LLM-based sentiment/emotion analysis from patient narratives and questionnaire text.
